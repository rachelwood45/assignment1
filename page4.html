    <strong>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</strong> <br><br></p>
    
    The results of these test reaffirmed for me how rare I thought my personality was. According to the results of the Myers Briggs test I am the Architect personality type, which forms just 2% of the population. <br>
    I have often felt as though I hold a viewpoint that is different to others around me. My opinions on romance and relationships are quite unconventional and I have always been proud of my strong and focused work ethic (as reinforced in the results of the Myers Briggs test).<br>
    Whilst some of these results are not shocking, it is still hard to read about aspects of my personality which are perceived as weaknesses. The Myers Briggs test results indicated that the Architect personality type has weaknesses such as being arrogant, emotionally dismissive and overly critical. <br><br>
    
    <strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour on a team?</strong> <br><br>
    Given that some of the feedback included weaknesses such as being overly critical, combative and arrogant, I am concerned that this will come across in my teamwork. I need to work on being patient and remember that I can learn so much from others. Normally, I tend to have my walls up and I’m convinced that I know best. I have recognised this behaviour in other aspects of my life where I have much more experience, however, both online study and IT are new to me so I must keep that in mind when engaging with others.<br><br>
    
    <strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong> <br><br>
    When forming teams, I think it will be beneficial for me to collaborate with others who appear as confident leaders. My results indicate that I have a low tolerance for those who aren’t driven to succeed and that once I lose respect for someone in a workplace setting it is hard for me to engage with them anymore. As there is so much teamwork in this course, I want to make sure I surround myself with those who seem as though they will get the work done. Being 90% introverted, I don’t think it would serve me well to work with others too much like me, hence the appeal of the leader/extroverted type to help drive the team.  <br><br>
