<h3 style="color: black;">Software Engineer, Google </h3><br><br>
<p>At such an early stage of my IT journey, it is hard to predict where I’ll be in the future and what ideals of mine will change. Given my limited knowledge of the IT industry, a Software Engineer role seems perfect right now. It seems broad enough that I’ll be able to grow with the role and expand on my existing interests.<br><br>
This job description is for a Software Engineer with Google. Essentially, the candidate would be responsible for implementing and maintaining various software solutions. It involves a wide range of skills which I hope to obtain through my studies and work-experience. Not only does this role entail aspects I am very interested in (troubleshooting, artificial intelligence, large scale network and data storage), it is also with a highly reputable and innovative global company. <br><br>
My current skillset is very basic. I am familiar with HTML and CSS at a beginner level, and I’ve had some troubleshooting experience with optical hardware and networks. <br><br>
Luckily, this role happens to be suitable for a graduate, however, I have made a list of steps I believe would be necessary to follow in order to land this role regardless: <br><br>
- Continue and complete the Bachelor of Information Technology degree. <br>
- Learn programming languages such as Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Go, etc. <br>
- Seek out an internship with a similar company or a similar role to gain real life experience. <br>
- Continue to research and develop my understanding of key elements of the role i.e. large-scale system design, UI design, artificial intelligence utilisation, etc.</p>
