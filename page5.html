<p style="color: black;">  
  <h2>Electronic Pet Food Dispenser</h2><br>
  <h3>Overview</h3> <br></p>
  
  <p style="width:500px">My IT project idea will be to create an electronic pet food dispenser using Raspberry Pi technology. This dispenser will have a feature that allows you to pre-record an audio message that will be played at mealtime. It comes with a large storage container for food, which makes it perfect for longer periods of time away from your pet. It is set up to provide your pet with portion-controlled amounts of food at your preferred times and is activated remotely using your phone. <br><br>This project will be designed with cats and dogs in mind, however, can be used for other domestic animals that require food which can be stored at room-temperature and that require regular meals, making it versatile and convenient.</p>  
  <br><br>
  <h3>Motivation</h3> <br>
  
  <p style="width:500px">As a cat-owner, I chose a product which I felt could make my life easier as well as every other pet-owner out there! Too many times my work schedule or personal commitments have meant that I am not home for regular feeding times. I have longed to be able to go out of an evening and not worry that my cat is waiting at home hungry.  
  
  <br><br>I also have a housemate whose schedule varies like mine, so being able to track feeding times electronically would give us both greater visibility and freedom.  <br><br>Being able to play a pre-recorded message to let the cat know itâ€™s feeding time would also give it a sense of comfort and familiarity, giving the product a greater chance of being used by a cat.  
  
  <br><br>There are many automated pet-feeders on the market, but I wanted to be able to create my own at a fraction of the price with inexpensive hardware and software. There seems to be a gap in the market for a device that can automatically feed, store large quantities of food, play audio and be controlled remotely.</p> 
  <br><br>
  <h3>Description</h3> <br> 
  
  <p style="width:500px">The aim of creating the electronic pet food dispenser is to provide peace of mind and convenience to the pet owner. It has 4 main features: <br><br>
  
  - Store large amounts of food making it usable over days not hours. <br><br>
  
  - Dispense the desired amount of food at the desired time.  <br><br>
  
  - Play an audio message to reassure the pet and allow it to build trust with the device.  <br><br>
  
  - Allow the user to control the device remotely, allowing greater freedom with work, social commitments, travel plans, etc. <br><br> 
  
  The dispenser is designed to release a custom amount of food for your pet at specified intervals. You can either leave it on this automated setting or activate the dispenser for a one-off feed in case your plans change at the last minute. This can be done by logging into the app on your phone and turning the dispenser on, rather having to set it before you leave the house.<br>  <br>
  The chance of food sitting out and attracting ants is greatly reduced, as the amount of food dispensed is controlled using a custom setting specific to your pet and their eating habits.  <br><br>
  All cords and cables are hidden away so that there can be no threat of an electronic shock to the pet or damage to key components of the device. <br><br>
  Food is poured into the top of the storage unit which has a small motor inside, allowing the bottom of the unit to spin open, letting food fall out into a bowl. The storage unit for the food is transparent, allowing you to easily observe how much food is in the device at any given time. <br><br>
  There is a small LED screen to indicate when the device is dispensing food, playing audio, battery status, etc. </p> 
<br><br>
  <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3> <br>  
  
  <p style="width:500px">To bring this device to life, I will need to draw on a mixture of software, hardware and physical labour. The key device in this project will be the Raspberry Pi. It will be where I develop my programming and coding skills to store instructions for the mechanics of the dispenser, as well as the audio information for the pre-recorded message. <br><br>I will need to source a small speaker to play the audio message, as well as an LED display screen. IoT technology will allow this product to be remotely controlled and I will do this via open-source frameworks such as Johnny-Five. </p> 
  <br><br>
  <h3>Skills required</h3> <br> 
  
  <p style="width:500px">The main skill required for this project will be being able to write a program for the dispenser using the Raspberry Pi. This is not something I have had experience with previously, however, there seems to be a lot of tutorials online for this technology, so I am confident that drawing on the resources available online will help me. I already have a Raspberry Pi so the cost of construction will be minimal. <br><br>There will also be an element of labour and assembly required to build the unit that will host the cables, attach it to the storage unit, connect the storage unit to a motor which will allow the dispensing of food, etc. I am familiar with general tools and assembly, so building the unit should be relatively straight forward. <br><br>The main challenge will come from programming the device so that it can be remotely controlled. By linking the Raspberry Pi up to my router and accessing the IP address from a remote monitor this should make it possible.</p>  
  <br><br>
  <h3>Outcome</h3> <br>  
  
  <p style="width:500px">If successful, the outcome of this project should leave me with a product that will not only be beneficial for myself and my cat, but also be a great product for many other pet owners. It will give both myself and others the flexibility to feed their pets no matter where they are and, most importantly, know that their pet is being fed the right amount at the right time. 
  This product could be commercially viable due to the large number of pet owners in Australia and the gap in the market it fills in terms of its multi-faceted functionality. </p>
