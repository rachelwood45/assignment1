<h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: #ffa500;text-align: center; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Interest in IT</h1><br>
<h3 style="color: black;">Interest in IT/when did it start? </h3><br><br>
    My interest in IT started from an early age. I always seemed to be the go-to person in my family when the PC was playing up or no one knew where to connect the cables behind the TV. My knack for picking things up quickly as a child gave me the confidence to start exploring different applications and programs as a teenager. I feel like I’ve watched the world change so much just in my lifetime and when I think about how we’ve progressed I always come back to the innovations in information technology. I am fascinated by what we can do with a simple home PC these days (let alone a Supercomputer Facility!). I feel like I am only just scratching the surface and I’m very eager to broaden my understanding of information technology in this age.</p><br>

<h3 style="color: black;">Why did you choose RMIT?</h3> <br><br>
    I chose to study with RMIT because of their outstanding reputation, not only as a university in general, but in the IT industry. I underwent some research to find the best university for IT and all signs pointed to RMIT. It’s one of the world’s highest rated universities and the focus on being employment-ready post-study was a huge appeal for me. In addition, both myself and the university are based in Melbourne, so I didn’t need to worry about working with different time zones, etc.</p><br>
    
<h3 style="color:black;">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3> <br><br>
Through my studies I hope to gain a better understanding of the IT industry. I would like to explore the career paths available to me and know how to get there. I hope to have a clearer picture of what a day in the life of an IT professional looks like and what the industry standards are. I expect I will learn a lot of new skills which will help my personal development and interests as well as make me more employable.</p>
